# The Agent-Centric Web: How AI Is Rewriting the Rules of the Internet

*The Agent-Centric Web: How AI Is Rewriting the Rules of the Internet* takes readers on a journey into the next great technological revolution—the shift from an app-driven digital world to one powered by intelligent AI agents.

For decades, humans have navigated the internet through websites, downloads, and endlessly fragmented apps. Today, that experience is collapsing into something radically simpler: **conversation**. Intelligent agents now understand natural language, coordinate digital services, and perform real-world tasks on our behalf—fundamentally changing how we work, learn, shop, communicate, and create.

This book explains the rise of the agent-centric web in clear, compelling detail—tracing the history of human–computer interaction, unpacking how modern AI agents function behind the scenes, and revealing why today’s internet architecture is no longer sustainable. Readers will explore the strategies of major technology leaders, including **OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, and Anthropic**, who are competing to define the platforms of the future.

## Big Questions

- Who controls the agent that controls your digital life?
- How do privacy, fairness, security, and competition survive in a world mediated by AI?
- Will this new web amplify human potential—or concentrate power more tightly than ever before?

Written for developers, business leaders, students, and curious readers alike, *The Agent-Centric Web* offers a rare combination of technical clarity, strategic insight, and ethical reflection. It is not merely a guide to emerging tools—it is a roadmap to understanding how the internet itself is being reinvented before our eyes.
